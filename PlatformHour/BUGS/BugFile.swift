// MARK: Bugs

// When on virtual controller, the player movement is continuous and cannot be stopped
// (Happens when the player goes on the next level via the exit.)
// It fixes itself when the app is killed and open again.

// MARK: - Feedbacks:

// the game controller inputs are too much faster than the action sequence.

// After falling, the player cannot move for a few seconds.

// The movement animation need to be less rapid on long press

// Hide the HUD when in dialog, cinematic or event that requires the full screen visual.

// Explain more the power system on the intro dialog (and setup it later).

// Changes a bit the intro text

// Changes the awkward camera changes or improve the camera movement before the spirit action.

// Add a circle effect when the spirit enter the dice.

// Fix the circular smoke drop en ground.

// The title appear everytime. Fix it or give a title for each level.

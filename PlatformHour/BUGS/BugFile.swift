import SwiftUI

// MARK: - FEEDBACK FIX:

// the game controller inputs are too much faster than the action sequence.

// After falling, the player cannot move for a few seconds.

// The movement animation need to be less rapid on long press

// Hide the HUD when in dialog, cinematic or event that requires the full screen visual.

// Explain more the power system on the intro dialog (and setup it later).
